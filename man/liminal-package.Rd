\title{liminal: interactive high-dimensional data visualisation}
\description{
liminal is an R package for constructing interactive visualisations designed
for exploratory high-dimensional data analysis. It's main purpose is to
combine tours with (non-linear) dimension reduction algorithms to provide a
more holistic view of the geometry and topology of a dataset. These
are designed for data analysts first, so they render either inside the
RStudio Viewer pane or from a web-browser using \code{shiny}.
}
\details{
There are two main functions for generating tour interfaces:
\itemize{
\item The basic tour scatter via \code{\link[=limn_tour]{limn_tour()}}
\item Linking tours to another view \code{\link[=limn_tour_link]{limn_tour_link()}}
}

For more details on the features and usage of liminal, see the vignettes:
