\title{Tour a high dimensional dataset}
\usage{
limn_tour(
  .data,
  cols,
  color = NULL,
  tour_path = tourr::grand_tour(),
  rescale = clamp,
  morph = "center"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a data.frame to tour}

\item{cols}{Columns to tour. This can use a tidyselect specification
such as \code{\link[tidyselect:starts_with]{tidyselect::starts_with()}}.}

\item{color}{A variable name in \code{.data}, mapping to the color aesthetic, if
NULL points will be colored black.}

\item{tour_path}{the tour path to take, the default is \code{\link[tourr:grand_tour]{tourr::grand_tour()}}
but also works with \code{\link[tourr:guided_tour]{tourr::guided_tour()}}.}

\item{rescale}{A function that rescales \code{cols}, the default is to
\code{\link[=clamp]{clamp()}} the data to lie in the hyperdimensional unit cube. To not perform
any scaling use \code{\link[=identity]{identity()}}.}

\item{morph}{One of \code{c("center", "centre", "identity", "radial")}
that rescales each projection along the tour path. The default
is to center the projections and divide by half range. See \code{\link[=morph_center]{morph_center()}}
for details.}
}
\value{
The tour interface loads a shiny app either in the Viewer pane
if you are using Rstudio or in a browser window. After iterating through
the tour and and highlighting subsets of interest, you can click the
'Done' button. This will return a named list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{selected_basis}: a matrix consisting of the final projection selected
\item \code{selected_brush}: a matrix consisting of the bounding box of brush
}
}
\description{
Tour a high dimensional dataset
}
\details{
The tour interface consists of two views:
\enumerate{
\item the tour view which is a dynamic scatterplot
\item the axis view which shows the direction and magnitude of the
basis vectors being generated.
}

There are several other user controls available:
\itemize{
\item A play button, that when pressed will start the tour animation.
\item A pause button, that when pressed will pause the tour animation.
\item The title of the view includes the half range. The half range
is a scale factor for projections and can be thought of as a way
of zooming in and out on points. It can be  modified by scrolling
(via a mouse-wheel movement). Double-click to reset to the default
tour view.
\item If categorical variable has been used, the legend can be toggled to
highlight categories of interest with shift + mouse click.
Multiple categories can be selected in this way. To reset double click
the legend title.
\item Brushing can be activtated by shift + mouse drag on the tour view.
If the tour animation a brush event will pause it.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# tour the first ten columns of the fake tree data
# loads the default interface
limn_tour(fake_trees, dim1:dim10)
# perform the same action but now coloring points
limn_tour(fake_trees, dim1:dim10, color = branches)
}
