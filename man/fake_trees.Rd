\description{
A high-dimensional tree data structure with 10 branching points.
}
\details{
Data are obtained from diffusion limited aggregation
tree simulation in the \code{phate} python and \code{phateR} packages, but
reconstructed as a wide data.frame rather than a list.

There are 3000 rows and 101 columns, the first 100 columns are labelled
dim1 - dim100, and are numeric, while the final column is a
factor representing the branch id.
