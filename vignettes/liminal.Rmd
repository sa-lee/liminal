The **liminal** R package is designed to help you understand and interrogate
non-linear dimension reduction results via the (grand) tour and linked
graphics. It offers two main functions that are useful for exploring
high-dimensional datasets, `limn_tour()` and `limn_tour_link()`. Both of these
functions create interactive visualisations that are embedded in 
either the RStudio Viewer pane or on a web browser through **shiny** [@R-shiny]. 

# Touring high-dimensional space

A tour is a dynamic visualisation that is displayed as a smooth animation
of low-dimensional projections. A high dimensional dataset is projected
onto a sequence of lower dimensional targets (also called bases) 
enabling the tour to explore the subspace of all lower dimensional 
projections. The way that targets are generated is called the tour path,
in **liminal** we default to using the grand tour, which generates random
Gaussian targets, although any tour path available in the **tourr** package
can be used [@tourr2011; @R-tourr]. For more details, see @Lee2021-gn for
a review of tour methods and @tourr2011 for their implementation in R. 


Let's take a look at an example, which has been adapted from the **phateR** 
package [@R-phateR; @phateR2019]..

The **liminal** package comes with a built in `data.frame` which is a high-dimensional tree 
structured dataset called `fake_trees`. It consists
of `r nrow(fake_trees)` observations over 100 numeric variables. The tree
can really be embedded in 2 dimensions and has 10 branches. 

First, let's generate principal components:

```{r pc-view}
library(liminal)
pcs  <- prcomp(fake_trees[, -ncol(fake_trees)])
# var explained
head(cumsum(pcs$sdev / sum(pcs$sdev)))
```

And visualise the results as scatter plot by augmenting the original data:

```{r pca-xy}
library(ggplot2)
fake_trees <- dplyr::bind_cols(fake_trees, as.data.frame(pcs$x))
ggplot(fake_trees, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = branches)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = limn_pal_tableau10())
```

We see some separation of the branches in first two principal components,
however, we can't see each of the branches clearly or their relation to each
other. 

We can tour the components that represent most of the variation in the 
data to get a sense of the underlying structure. 

The following code generates a shiny application, that provides an interface 
to the tour:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this loads a shiny app on the first fifteen PCs
limn_tour(fake_trees, cols = PC1:PC15, color = branches)
```
The interface consists of the tour view which is a dynamic scatterplot
and an axis view which corresponds to magnitude and direction of 
the generated targets.


```{r interface, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/limn_tour_basic.png")
```

From the tour view, we can see that the blue branch is hidden (after
highlighting it and letting the animation play) and forms the
backbone of the tree. 

Brushing on the tour view is activated with the shift key plus a mouse drag. 
It will highlight points that fall inside the brush and
pause the current view. 

There are several additional interactions available on this view:
  * There is a play button, that when pressed will start the tour.
  * There is also a text view of the half range which is the maximum squared
    Euclidean distance between points in the tour view. The half range
    is a scale factor for projections and can be thought of as a way
    of zooming in and out on points. It can be dynamically modified by scrolling
    (via a mouse-wheel). To reset double click the tour view.
  * The legend can be toggled to highlight groups of points with
    shift+mouse-click. Multiple groups can be selected in this way. To
    reset double click the legend title.

You can play with the app to exploring this  data [here]() if you would
like to try it out without installing the package first. Please note that
the liminal applications are optimised for view in the RStudio Viewer pane.



# Adding non-linear embeddings

We can also compare this to t-SNE embedding run with default settings:

```{r tsne-xy}
set.seed(2099)
tsne <- Rtsne::Rtsne(dplyr::select(fake_trees, dplyr::starts_with("dim")))

tsne_df <- data.frame(tsneX = tsne$Y[,1],
                      tsneY = tsne$Y[,2])
ggplot(tsne_df, aes(x = tsneX, y = tsneY, color = fake_trees$branches)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = limn_pal_tableau10())
```

The topology is a little messed up as the blue branch is now broken into two 
distinct pieces. 

We can see where our embedding is different via a linked tour:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
limn_tour_link(embed_data = tsne_df,
               tour_data = fake_trees,
               cols = PC1:PC10, # tour columns to select
               color = branches # variable to highlight across both view, can come for either data frames
)
```

This function requires two tables that will be linked together in separate views. 
The tour interface is the same as above, except now
brushing on the tour view will highlight points on the right hand side
scatter plot. 
The right hand side scatterplot view is an interactive scatterplot.  
Brushing on the right view is activated via click and drag movements. 

```{r limn-interface, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/limn_tour_basic.png")
```

We can see from brushing on the right, where t-SNE has broken up the global
structure in the data and distorted the distance between points. 
For either interface, you can assign the results to an R object, that will
return a list consisting of the selected basis (target) and the brushing bounding
boxes. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res <- limn_tour_link(embed_data = tsne_df,
               tour_data = fake_trees,
               cols = PC1:PC10, # tour columns to select
               color = branches # variable to highlight across both view, can come for either data frames
)
```

You can play with the app to exploring this embedding and data [here]().
